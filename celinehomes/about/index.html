                <p><span>Celine moved from France to Silicon Valley in 1994 and never looked back. She has called Menlo Park home since marrying her husband, Michael, in 1997. Their three children attend the Menlo Park public elementary schools and high school.</span><br><br><span>Her love for the real estate profession started when she was very young, as she designed multiple dream homes on note books. Over the years, she worked towards making her dream job a reality by obtaining her DRE license in 2005, closing single homes and investment properties transactions, and renovating and designing several homes. Her unique experience lies in identifying undervalued properties and renovating within budget and schedule to maximize value. Her negotiation skills will allow buyers to win in competitive situations. With Celineâ€™s guidance, a good offer will become a great offer compelling to sellers.</span><br><br><span>Thanks to a deep knowledge of the local market, Celine will fine-tune listing prices, leading to multiple offers that will greatly satisfy sellers.</span><br><br>License #01519887 </p>
