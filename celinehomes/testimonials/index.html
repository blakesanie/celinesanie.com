                    <p>I really appreciated how organized and comprehensive Celine was throughout our entire home buying process. I never worried that she would not represent us well or miss an important transaction detail. As a buyer, it was extremely important that she help find the right home for our family at a price that was affordable and yet in alignment with market conditions. She was careful in her analysis and negotiations on our behalf, and kind and straightforward in her advice. We are more than thrilled with our new home!<br><br><span>- Kathy K.</span></p>

                    <p>Celine helped us purchase our first home in California in Menlo Park. As first-time California home buyers in a hot market, we needed a lot of information to come up the learning curve. Celine provided us with patient, thoughtful, and realistic analyses, and she quickly learned our preferences so she could guide us to listings that would suit our needs, within our budget. She is incredibly responsive and efficient. She made herself available at all hours of the day and night to suit our busy work and travel schedules. And she is a lovely and kid person. We loved working with her.<br><br><span>- Shelley W.</span></p>

                    <p>I still remember the first time I met Celine, when my wife and I just started our home buying process. At that time we were not represented by any agent yet, so she helped us write our very first offer. Immediately after that, I decided to work with Celine exclusively as I felt she really truly cared about our best interest, not just closing a deal. I am so glad I made that choice, because in the end she helped us purchase our dream home. Her advice was very valuable, especially for first-time buyers like us. She knows the local market and does a lot of homework for the condition of the house, the neighborhood, etc... She knows how to handle a bidding war, and her bargain strategy saved us a lot of money in our final deal.<br><br><span>- Shilin D.</span></p>

                    <p>I have worked with over 10 different realtors when purchasing and selling various properties. I started working with Celine over a year ago while looking for an investment property. I have been very impressed with Celine. She is honest, trustworthy and very hard working. Whether it is taking the extra step of presenting an offer in person or trudging through the mud with me looking at the potential pitfalls of a property, she consistently goes above and beyond what I expect. She also blends a unique capability to both envision what can be done with a property, as well as having an analytical mind to know any issues that I might face. I highly recommend her.<br><br><span>- Bob H.</span></p>

                    <p>Celine helped us buy our beach house when there was seemingly no inventory on the market. She had to use creativity and perseverance to uncover some great opportunities. To top it all off, we actually got more house than we thought was possible at a price that was lower than market.<br><br><span>- Doug K.</span></p>

                    <p>Celine really goes the extra mile. As we were going to relocate to White Salmon, Washington, in the middle of our daughter’s softball season, she found a local league that would take her on and arranged for her to start on her new team before we had even moved. It made the transition a lot easier for my daughter.<br><br><span>- Patti S.</span></p>

                    <p>From careful listening to clear thinking to committed professionalism, Celine brings it to her work in every realm. As a newcomer to Menlo Park, I was thrilled to meet Celine, who invited me to lunch and shared dozens of tips on local shopping, gluten-free dining, and kids’ classes. If I needed information not at her fingertips, Celine would surprise me with the details within hours. We’ve since become good friends, and while I no longer need help finding things around town, I still count her as my go-to gal for good ideas on just about everything.<br><br><span>- Perri C.</span></p>
