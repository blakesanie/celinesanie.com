          >Celine moved from France to Silicon Valley in 1994 and never looked
          back. She has called Menlo Park home since marrying her husband,
          Michael, in 1997. Their three children attend the Menlo Park public
          elementary schools and high school.</span

          >After many years writing/reviewing/editing technical manuals in
          engineering departments of high-tech companies, Celine is keeping her
          love for writing alive with College Essay Coaching. She became
          proficient with application prompts and what college admissions are
          looking for while guiding her two older children through the college
          application process.</span
