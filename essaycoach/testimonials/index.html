            Celine’s emphasis on conversations and collaboration helped me to
            build my ideas and allow my voice to shine through. Her honest
            feedback and patience when I was struggling with an idea made me
            feel comfortable and we’d work through challenges together. She also
            set a very good timeline for me, keeping me ahead of schedule which
            reduced my stress. Lastly, Celine was very flexible, whether it was
            rescheduling a meeting or giving me extra time. Overall, I credit
            Celine for helping me find my voice and share my unique qualities in
            my applications and essays.

            Through Celine’s constant questioning, I was able to realize my
            thoughts. She knows how to make an essay stand out even though the
            idea may be common. For example, many people write essays about
            soccer, and the first soccer essay I wrote was not unique. She
            helped turn it into a mental-barrier essay even though it was about
            soccer.

            Not only did working with Celine help me organize all my deadlines
            and create achievable weekly writing goals to get all my
            applications in on time, but she helped brainstorm essay topics
            using my passions and hobbies to convey who I am. I found her
            feedback to be very insightful. It strengthened my essays so I was
            proud of the writing I submitted. If I ever had a question about
            anything on the application I could always ask her and felt very
            supported through the whole process which is really important. I am
            sure my words don't do justice to how amazing she was as a college
            essay coach. I completely recommend any high schooler starting this
            process to work with her!

            I have a tendency to write way over the word limit and it usually
            takes me hours to cut down my essays. Celine knew exactly what
            needed to stay and what needed to go in my essays. Working with
            Celine saved me so much time and stress. She was very supportive,
            direct, and clear. I couldn’t imagine having someone better to work
            with during such a stressful process, and I often wish that Celine
            could look over my work when writing internship applications now
            that I’m in college.

            My son is a senior at Menlo Atherton High School and is currently
            submitting college applications. It is all going pretty smoothly,
            thanks to his work over the past several months with Celine Sanie.
            Most importantly Celine coached him through the writing of his
            essays. There was a good chemistry / temperament match between the
            two. She set deadlines for him and held him accountable to meet
            them. Working with Celine took a lot of stress off the rest of the
            household. Overall, I highly recommend Celine. Even if you have a
            senior and are currently in the thick of it, she may be able to
            help.

            Our family highly recommends Celine as a college essay coach. She is
            extremely organized, prepared and knowledgeable. She successfully
            guided our daughter in creating a personalized product which was
            entirely in her voice and hand. She managed this by providing
            structured, critical and insightful feedback. After each session,
            she provided us with a short summary, but it was up to our child to
            schedule and be prepared for all appointments. Finally, our daughter
            enjoyed working with Celine during what is an extremely stressful
            time.

            Celine's children have gone and are going through M-A so she has
            great context for the resources and timelines at the school.
            Celine's services are a great alternative to some of the other
            expensive college counseling options that have a mass pipeline.
            Celine also gets along remarkably well with teenagers. Highly
            recommend!

            I highly recommend Celine for her excellent college-related
            services. She was an essential resource for my son as he created all
            his college application essays and information in a way that told
            his story. Celine's support enabled my son to have college
            applications not only ready early but something he was proud to
            submit!
