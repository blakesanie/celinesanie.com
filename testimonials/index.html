            Celine's children have gone and are going through M-A so she has
            great context for the resources and timelines at the school.
            Celine's services are a great alternative to some of the other
            expensive college counseling options that have a mass pipeline.
            Celine also gets along remarkably well with teenagers. Highly
            recommend!

            I highly recommend Celine for her excellent college-related
            services. She was an essential resource for my son as he created all
            his college application essays and information in a way that told
            his story. Celine's support enabled my son to have college
            applications not only ready early but something he was proud to
            submit!

            Through Celine’s constant questioning, I was able to realize my
            thoughts. She knows how to make an essay stand out even though the
            idea may be common. For example, many people write essays about
            soccer, and the first soccer essay I wrote was not unique. She
            helped turn it into a mental-barrier essay even though it was about
            soccer.

            I have a tendency to write way over the word limit and it usually
            takes me hours to cut down my essays. Celine knew exactly what
            needed to stay and what needed to go in my essays. Working with
            Celine saved me so much time and stress. She was very supportive,
            direct, and clear. I couldn’t imagine having someone better to work
            with during such a stressful process, and I often wish that Celine
            could look over my work when writing internship applications now
            that I’m in college.

            Working with Celine was extremely beneficial to my college app
            process. One of the most helpful aspects was creating a timed plan
            of when each aspect of my applications would be finished by. It
            allowed me to thoroughly complete all essays/apps/information
            without dealing with my procrastination. My favorite thing she did
            was “interview” me in the beginning, to gauge what aspects of ME
            would be good for essays and personal questions - it made me feel
            like I was showcasing myself the best I could.

            Our family highly recommends Celine as a college essay coach. She is
            extremely organized, prepared and knowledgeable. She successfully
            guided our daughter in creating a personalized product which was
            entirely in her voice and hand. She managed this by providing
            structured, critical and insightful feedback. After each session,
            she provided us with a short summary, but it was up to our child to
            schedule and be prepared for all appointments. Finally, our daughter
            enjoyed working with Celine during what is an extremely stressful
            time.

            Celine’s emphasis on conversations and collaboration helped me to
            build my ideas and allow my voice to shine through. Her honest
            feedback and patience when I was struggling with an idea made me
            feel comfortable and we’d work through challenges together. She also
            set a very good timeline for me, keeping me ahead of schedule which
            reduced my stress. Lastly, Celine was very flexible, whether it was
            rescheduling a meeting or giving me extra time. Overall, I credit
            Celine for helping me find my voice and share my unique qualities in
            my applications and essays.

            My son is a senior at Menlo Atherton High School and is currently
            submitting college applications. It is all going pretty smoothly,
            thanks to his work over the past several months with Celine Sanie.
            Most importantly Celine coached him through the writing of his
            essays. There was a good chemistry / temperament match between the
            two. She set deadlines for him and held him accountable to meet
            them. Working with Celine took a lot of stress off the rest of the
            household. Overall, I highly recommend Celine. Even if you have a
            senior and are currently in the thick of it, she may be able to
            help.

            Not only did working with Celine help me organize all my deadlines
            and create achievable weekly writing goals to get all my
            applications in on time, but she helped brainstorm essay topics
            using my passions and hobbies to convey who I am. I found her
            feedback to be very insightful. It strengthened my essays so I was
            proud of the writing I submitted. If I ever had a question about
            anything on the application I could always ask her and felt very
            supported through the whole process which is really important. I am
            sure my words don't do justice to how amazing she was as a college
            essay coach. I completely recommend any high schooler starting this
            process to work with her!

            Our daughter’s senior year began in Fall 2021 on a progressive path
            to completing college applications on-time, for regular decision.
            However, she did not anticipate the added rigor of returning to
            school in person and participating in a fall varsity sport, all
            while allowing time to reconnect with her fellow seniors. In early
            September, a friend recommended Celine as our daughter's “lifeline”.
            Celine's extensive experience as a College Essay Coach, as well as
            having a finger on the pulse of the college admissions process is
            PRICELESS! My daughter felt immediate stress relief, and renewed
            confidence after her first session. Celine engages directly with the
            student, guides in brain-storming essay topics, edits essays, and
            teaches time management - the exact support my daughter required to
            successfully apply to all colleges of her choice.

            Our daughter really enjoyed the process and working with you! She looked forward to her sessions with you, and my husband and I thought her essays were not only well written but also insightful and really representative of the amazing individual she is. So thank you so much for more than just helping guide her essay writing.

            Thank you for all the work you put in helping M.! She really enjoyed your sessions and guidance and would come back those days after school telling me all the things she worked on. You’ll be happy to hear that she was “bored” last night so submitted all her apps! She’s delighted. I’ll reach out in a few years when her sister is a Junior.
